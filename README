A text generator written as a code sample. This program will absorb multiple sources of sample text and
generate random pieces of text resembling in style the provided samples. Currently it is using a fairly
simple implementation of Markov chains.

Additional generators:

Other generators may be implemented by adding more generator classes under generators. Each generator is expected to
implement importFile(), generateText() and dumpState() and initialize with database file name as a string. Additional
engines will need to be included in the imports in generate.py and added to the option parsing statement.

Limitations:

* No checking is done for compatibility between the engine used and database imported. When using an existing database
make sure that you are using the same engine as was used for generating the database.

* The current implementation is not optimized for performance, so generating very large texts or using very large databases
is not recommended.
